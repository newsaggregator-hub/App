# Vercel Deployment Fix âœ…

## Problem
Vercel deployment was failing with the error: "No Output Directory named 'public' found after the Build completed."

## Root Cause
Vercel expects static files to be in a `public` directory by default, but the project had HTML, CSS, and JS files in the root directory.

## Solution Applied
1. **Moved static files to `public/` directory**:
   - `index.html` â†’ `public/index.html`
   - `styles.css` â†’ `public/styles.css`
   - `script.js` â†’ `public/script.js`

2. **Updated `vercel.json` configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "buildCommand": "npm run build",
     "outputDirectory": "public",
     "functions": {
       "api/signup.js": {
         "maxDuration": 10
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Updated `.gitignore`** - Removed `public` from the ignore list to allow the directory to be tracked by git

## Key Changes
- **File Structure**: Static files moved to `public/` directory to meet Vercel's expected structure
- **Build Configuration**: Updated `outputDirectory` to point to the correct location
- **Git Tracking**: Ensured the public directory is tracked by git

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub. The deployment should now work correctly on Vercel.

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Vercel should automatically redeploy the application
2. The build should complete successfully
3. The website should be accessible at the Vercel deployment URL

---
**Next**: Vercel should automatically detect the changes and redeploy successfully! ðŸš€

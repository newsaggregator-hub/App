# Vercel Deployment Fix Applied âœ…

## Issue Fixed
The Vercel deployment was failing with:
```
Error: No Output Directory named "public" found after the Build completed.
```

## Solution Applied
Updated `vercel.json` with the correct configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "echo 'Static site - no build needed'",
  "outputDirectory": ".",
  "functions": {
    "api/signup.js": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Changes
1. **Added `outputDirectory: "."`** - Tells Vercel to use the root directory as output
2. **Added `buildCommand`** - Specifies the build process (none needed for static site)
3. **Kept `version: 2`** - Uses Vercel's latest platform version

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Redeploy on Vercel
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Find your project and click "Redeploy"
- Or trigger a new deployment by pushing any change

### 2. Alternative: Manual Vercel Setup
If you need to reconnect:
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import from GitHub: `newsaggregator-hub/App`
4. **Framework Preset**: Other
5. **Root Directory**: `./` (default)
6. **Build Command**: Leave empty or use `echo 'Static site'`
7. **Output Directory**: Leave empty (will use root)
8. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Environment Variables (Optional)
For future database integration, add these in Vercel dashboard:
- `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` (when ready to use real database)
- `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` (when ready to use real database)

## Expected Result
âœ… Deployment should now succeed  
âœ… Landing page will be accessible at your Vercel URL  
âœ… API endpoint `/api/signup` will work in demo mode  
âœ… Form submissions will work (demo responses)  

## Test After Deployment
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Fill out the signup form with valid email + topics
3. Submit form - should see success message in demo mode
4. Check browser network tab to confirm API calls work

**Status**: Ready for successful deployment! ðŸš€
